◊h1{The Eyes Have It}

A little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically, you could
find this type of humor anywhere. But only a topflight science-fictionist, we
thought, could have written this story, in just this way...

It was quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of Earth by
lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven’t done anything about it; I
can’t think of anything to do. I wrote to the Government, and they sent back a
pamphlet on the repair and maintenance of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing
is known; I’m not the first to discover it. Maybe it’s even under control.
